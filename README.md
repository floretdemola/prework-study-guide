# Prework-Study-Guide-Webpage

## A study guide for course pre-work.
This Prework Study Guide was created to boot camp students who were going through the Prework. Students can review the notes in each section. This serves a purpose to help students understand the basics of coding with quick and clear understanding of what each fundamental element consist of such as HTML, CSS, Git, & JavaScript. This has helped me learn how to build this webpage and what went into it behind the scenes.

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
